## ⚠️ Project In Progress - Learning TypeScript

**Warning:** This project is currently under development as I am converting it to TypeScript to learn and explore the language. The project is based on a customized version of [jqCron](https://github.com/arnapou/jqcron), with added `sync type of 2 field` feature and Bootstrap 5 support.

- **Status**: Active development and experimentation
- **Note**: Expect frequent changes, potential bugs, and incomplete functionality as I work through the learning process.

Feel free to browse the code or contribute, but please be aware that this is a learning project and may not be production-ready.

Thank you for your understanding!
